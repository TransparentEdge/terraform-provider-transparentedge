## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    transparentedge = {
      source = "TransparentEdge/transparentedge"
      # Available since version 0.5.0
      version = ">=0.5.0"
    }
  }
}

# This resource requires a credential
# Example for 'AWS (Route53)'
resource "transparentedge_certreq_dns_credential" "aws_01" {
  alias = "aws-creds-01"

  parameters = {
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "ABC"
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = "DEF"
  }
}

resource "transparentedge_certreq_dns" "dns_cr_example_com" {
  credential = transparentedge_certreq_dns_credential.aws_01.id

  # DNS Certificate Request can generated wildcard certificates
  domains = ["example.com", "*.example.com"]
}

data "transparentedge_certreq_dns" "dns_cr_example_com" {
  id = transparentedge_certreq_dns.dns_cr_example_com.id
}

output "example_com" {
  value = data.transparentedge_certreq_dns.dns_cr_example_com
}

## Schema

### Required

- `credential` (Number) DNS Credential associated.
- `domains` (Set of String) List of domains for which you want to request a certificate. You can include wildcard domains, such as `*.example.com`, to cover subdomains under a common domain.

### Read-Only

- `certificate_id` (Number) Certificate ID. It will be `null` in case of failure or when the certificate request is in progress.
- `created_at` (String) Date of creation.
- `id` (Number) ID of the DNS Certificate Request.
- `status_message` (String) Indicates the current status message for the certificate request. This field will display a success message if the certificate is obtained successfully or an error message if the request fails. When the certificate request is in progress or if there is no status message available, it will be represented as `null`.
- `updated_at` (String) Date of last update.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import DNS Certificate Request by ID
terraform import 'transparentedge_certreq_dns.dnscertreq' 147
```
