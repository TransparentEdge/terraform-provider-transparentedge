# transparentedge_staging_vclconf (Resource)

Manages Staging VCL Configuration

## Example Usage

```terraform
# The usage of the resource 'staging_vclconf' is exactly the same as the production resource 'vclconf'
# for extended documentation refer to 'vclconf' taking care to replace 'vclconf' by 'staging_vclconf'

resource "transparentedge_staging_vclconf" "staging" {
  vclcode = <<EOF
sub vcl_recv {
    # Staging configuration
    if (req.http.host == "www.example.com") {
        set req.backend_hint = cX_stmyorigin.backend();
        set req.http.TCDN-i3-transform = "auto_webp";
        set req.http.TCDN-Command = "brotli_compress";
        call redirect_https;
    }
}
EOF
}

output "staging_config" {

## Schema

### Required

- `vclcode` (String) Verbatim of the VCL (_Varnish Configuration Language_) code configuration to apply. After a successful code upload, it may take between 5 and 10 minutes for the new configuration to be fully replicated in all the CDN edge nodes. You can check if a configuration is already in **staging** by running `terraform plan` and checking the `productiondate` field.

### Read-Only

- `company` (Number) Company ID that owns this Staging VCL Config
- `id` (Number) ID of the Staging VCL Config
- `productiondate` (String) Date when the configuration was fully applied in the CDN
- `uploaddate` (String) Date when the configuration was uploaded
- `user` (String) User that created the configuration

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import the active VCL configuration, the ID value doesn't matter.
terraform import 'transparentedge_staging_vclconf.staging' 0

# Importing VCL code has its quirks, since the API parses the code and
# add/removes newlines and spaces the diff won't be equal, it's usually
# better to just copy the last configuration from the dashboard and
# apply again.
```
