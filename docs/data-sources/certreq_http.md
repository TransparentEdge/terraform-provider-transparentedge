## Schema

### Required

- `id` (Number) ID of the HTTP Certificate Request.

### Read-Only

- `certificate_id` (Number) Certificate associated.
- `created_at` (String) Date of creation.
- `domains` (Set of String) List of domains for which you want to request a certificate. You can **not** include wildcard domains, such as `*.example.com`, use DNS Certificate Requests instead.
- `standalone` (Boolean) When set to `true`, this indicates that the certificate's domains should be treated as standalone and not merged into an existing certificate, either immediately or during future renewals.
- `status_message` (String) Indicates the current status message for the certificate request. This field will display an error message if the request fails. When the certificate request is in progress or if there is no status message available, it will be represented as `null`.
- `updated_at` (String) Date of last update.
