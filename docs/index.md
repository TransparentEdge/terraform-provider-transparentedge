# TransparentEdge Terraform Provider

A terraform provider for the CDN of [Transparent Edge](https://www.transparentedge.eu/).
This provider is intended to be used by the CDN users with the role "Company Admin", although some services do not require this role.

## Example usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    transparentedge = {
      version = ">= 0.2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "transparentedge" {
  # Provider configuration overrides environment variables
  # it's recommended to use environment variables for company_id, client_id and client_secret
  company_id    = 300
  client_id     = "XXX"
  client_secret = "XXX"
  verify_ssl    = true                             # this is the default value
  api_url       = "https://api.transparentcdn.com" # this is the default value
}


data "transparentedge_sites" "all" {
}
```

It's recommended to use environment variables:  

```shell
export TCDN_COMPANY_ID=0
export TCDN_CLIENT_ID="xxx"
export TCDN_CLIENT_SECRET="xxx"
```

You can find all the required variables in our [our dashboard](https://dashboard.transparentcdn.com/).
Login, go to your profile -> "Account options" -> "Manage keys".

Make sure that you're using the correct Company ID if you own multiple companies.  

Optional environment variables:  

```shell
export TCDN_HOST_URL="https://api.transparentcdn.com"
export TCDN_VERIFY_SSL=true
```
