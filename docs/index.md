# TransparentEdge Terraform Provider

A terraform provider for the CDN of [Transparent Edge](https://www.transparentedge.eu/).  
This provider is intended to be used by the CDN users with the role "Company Admin", although some services do not require this role.

## Example usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    transparentedge = {
      source  = "TransparentEdge/transparentedge"
      version = ">=0.3.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "transparentedge" {
  # Provider configuration overrides environment variables
  # it's recommended to use environment variables for company_id, client_id and client_secret
  company_id    = 300
  client_id     = "XXX"
  client_secret = "XXX"
  insecure      = false                            # this is the default value
  api_url       = "https://api.transparentcdn.com" # this is the default value
  auth          = true                             # false if you only use data-sources that do not require authentication such as 'transparentedge_ip_ranges'
}
```

It's recommended to use environment variables:  

```shell
export TCDN_COMPANY_ID=0
export TCDN_CLIENT_ID="xxx"
export TCDN_CLIENT_SECRET="xxx"
```

You can find all the required variables in our [dashboard](https://dashboard.transparentcdn.com/): `"Profile" -> "Account options" -> "Manage keys".`  

Make sure that you're using the correct Company ID if you own multiple companies.  

Optional environment variables:  

```shell
# Not required, default values are:
export TCDN_API_URL="https://api.transparentcdn.com"
export TCDN_INSECURE=false
```
